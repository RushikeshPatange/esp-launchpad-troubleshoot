                        establishing step then your device might be not connected properly to port
                        or their might be the
                        <strong>browser compatability issue</strong>. Please
                        ensure that it is properly connected to the port. Reseating
                        connection cable might also helps to resolve this issue.

                        ESP Launchpad makes use of <strong>Web Serial API</strong> to
                        communicate with the device. Currently Safari & Firefox browsers
                        don't support it yet. We will add support for this browser as soon
                        as Safari & Firefox starts supporting Web Serial API. Please find
                        more about <strong>Web Serial API</strong> browser compatability

                        It has been seen that on <strong>windows system</strong> with latest <strong>Silicon Lab CP210x USB to UART Bridge</strong>
                        there are device connection or flashing issues.We are looking into it to resolve the issue.
                        You can still try by downgrading silicon lab CP210x USB to UART Bridge driver version to <code>6.7.x</code> that can resolve issue on temporarily basis.
